Simply make a file called logins.txt and put all ur combos in it, this checker works proxyless and captchaless so no need for anything else besides python version 3.10.8 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3108/)
it wont work if its any newer version of python than 3.10.8 and also what you need is module requests installed and module styling  and beautifulsoup4 installed, you can just simply do command
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -r  requirements.txt` once thats done just run the coinledger.py file and it should do all the job itself. GL
